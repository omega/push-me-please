h1. push-me-please

Simple enough. We trigger a test_postrecieve on a repo, that we have configured to
have a postbin url as it's post commit hook. Then we poll the feed, find the IP, and
"store" it. Simple web page to list IPs seen so far.

We needed this because the firewall of our company network blocks requests to our
build-servers, but we need the post commit hooks, so we need to open those. They
sometimes change, so now we can track them :)
